# Problem Statement
The fictional retail store noticed their prices were not optimized and sought a data analyst to investigate historical prices, identify crucial price factors, analyze the markets and economic contexts, and customer purchasing behavior to optimize pricing strategies.

# Objectives
* Select and analyze relevant pricing key factors and their influence on prices.
* Calculate the optimal selling prices for products to create efficient, data-driven recommendations.

# Methodology
* Data Collection: I obtained a comprehensive retail dataset from Kaggle containing 30 columns such as product categories, historical prices, quanity,volume, competitor prices.
* Data Extraction, Cleansing, and Transformation: To ensure the dataset was ready for analysis, I used Python for data extraction, cleansing, and transformation. The following were fixed in the dataset:
   * Changed column names "product_name_lenght" to "product_name_length", "product_description_lenght" to "product_description_length", "month_year to date" and "total_price to    revenue".
   * Converted the date format to a short date format for consistency and ease of analysis.
   * Created groups for product scores(1, 2, & 3) and consolidated them into a simplified product_score column .

* Analysis: To extract insights from the dataset I conducted various SQL queries in MySQL server and Tableau visualizations .
* Recommendations: Provided actionable recommendations based on insights from data analysis.

# SQL Queries and Tableau Visualizations

1. Identified top selling products:
SELECT product_category_name, ROUND(SUM(revenue), 2) AS total_revenue
FROM Retail_Data.Retail_Sales
GROUP BY product_category_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
2. Analyzing Monthly Revenue Trends:
SELECT
product_id, DATE_FORMAT(date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
Round(SUM(revenue),2) AS monthly_revenue
FROM Retail_Data.Retail_Sales
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 2;
4. Average Unit Price and Competitor Prices by Product Category:
SELECT 
    product_category_name, 
    ROUND(AVG(unit_price), 2) AS avg_unit_price, 
    ROUND(AVG(comp_1), 2) AS avg_comp_1_price, 
    ROUND(AVG(comp_2), 2) AS avg_comp_2_price, 
    ROUND(AVG(comp_3), 2) AS avg_comp_3_price
FROM 
    Retail_Data.Retail_Sales
GROUP BY 1;

5. Percentage of Products Priced Lower than Competitors:
SELECT 
    product_id, 
    product_category_name,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN comp_1 > unit_price THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / CAST(COUNT(*) AS FLOAT) * 100, 2) AS percent_lower_than_comp_1,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN comp_2 > unit_price THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / CAST(COUNT(*) AS FLOAT) * 100, 2) AS percent_lower_than_comp_2,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN comp_3 > unit_price THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / CAST(COUNT(*) AS FLOAT) * 100, 2) AS percent_lower_than_comp_3
FROM 
    Retail_Data.Retail_Sales
GROUP BY 1,2;

6. Sales impact when priced higher or lower than competitors:
    SELECT 
    product_id,
    product_category_name,
    ROUND(AVG(unit_price), 2) AS avg_unit_price,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN comp_1 > unit_price THEN revenue ELSE NULL END), 2) AS avg_revenue_lower_than_comp_1,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN comp_1 < unit_price THEN revenue ELSE NULL END), 2) AS avg_revenue_higher_than_comp_1,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN comp_2 > unit_price THEN revenue ELSE NULL END), 2) AS avg_revenue_lower_than_comp_2,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN comp_2 < unit_price THEN revenue ELSE NULL END), 2) AS avg_revenue_higher_than_comp_2,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN comp_3 > unit_price THEN revenue ELSE NULL END), 2) AS avg_revenue_lower_than_comp_3,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN comp_3 < unit_price THEN revenue ELSE NULL END), 2) AS avg_revenue_higher_than_comp_3
FROM 
    Retail_Data.Retail_Sales
GROUP BY 1,2 ;
7. Sales volume impact by Price range:
    SELECT 
    product_category_name,
    SUM(CASE WHEN unit_price BETWEEN 0 AND 50 THEN qty ELSE 0 END) AS qty_sold_0_50,
    SUM(CASE WHEN unit_price > 50 THEN qty ELSE 0 END) AS qty_sold_abv_50
FROM 
    Retail_Data.Retail_Sales
GROUP BY 1;

 8. Customer Segmentation based on purchasing behavior
WITH customer_segments AS (
    SELECT
        product_id,
        SUM(qty) AS total_quantity,
        SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue,
        COUNT(DISTINCT customers) AS customers_count
    FROM
        Retail_Data.Retail_Sales
    GROUP BY
        product_id
)
SELECT
    product_id,
    customers_count AS unique_customers,
    total_quantity,
    total_revenue,
    CASE
        WHEN total_revenue >= 10000 THEN 'High Value Customer'
        WHEN total_revenue >= 5000 THEN 'Medium Value Customer'
        ELSE 'Low Value Customer'
    END AS customer_segment
FROM
    customer_segments
ORDER BY
    total_revenue DESC;
