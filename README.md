# PROBLEM STATEMENT
The fictional retail store noticed their prices were not optimized and sought a data analyst to investigate historical prices, identify crucial price factors, analyze the markets and economic contexts, and customer purchasing behavior to optimize pricing strategies.

# Objectives
* Select and analyze relevant pricing key factors and their influence on prices.
* Calculate the optimal selling prices for products to create efficient, data-driven recommendations.

# Methodology
* Data Collection: I obtained a comprehensive retail dataset from Kaggle containing 30 columns such as product categories, historical prices, quanity,volume, competitor prices,time etc.
* Data Extraction, Cleansing, and Transformation: To ensure the dataset was ready for analysis, I used Python for data extraction, cleansing, and transformation. The following were fixed in the dataset:
   * Changed column names "product_name_lenght" to "product_name_length", "product_description_lenght" to "product_description_length", "month_year to date" and "total_price to    revenue".
   * Converted the date format to a short date format for consistency and ease of analysis.
   * Created groups for product scores(1, 2, & 3) and consolidated them into a simplified product_score column .

* Analysis: To extract insights from the dataset I conducted various SQL queries and Tableau visualizations .
* Recommendations: Provided actionable recommendations based on insights from data analysis.
